### The Missing Piece

Most AI inference today goes into generating videos and images.  
Everyone’s racing to build better _nanobanana wrappers_ — but no one’s building the infrastructure layer that makes it easy for developers to actually use them.

There’s no **Vercel for AI media**, no **one-click deploy** experience.  
No one is rethinking the user experience — the _Cursor_ moment — like how devs moved from copy-pasting from ChatGPT to coding inside Cursor.

That’s exactly what I’m building.

### The Problem

When building my own AI media app, I hit two major roadblocks:

1. **Messy image generation pipelines.**  
   Managing prompts, parameters, and outputs as code became unmanageable fast.

2. **Media delivery and performance.**  
   I had to handle image/video storage, retrieval, and compression myself — just to make things load fast enough to be usable.

### The Solution

A **node-based canvas**, like Excalidraw, for visually constructing AI media generation pipelines.  
Design your entire workflow — prompts, transformations, filters — without touching messy backend code.

Behind the scenes, an **API and infrastructure layer** handles:

- Integration with image/video generation models (like Nanobanana)
- Media compression, caching, and CDN delivery
- Storage and retrieval out of the box

Developers simply call the API — and get optimized, ready-to-serve media instantly.

### Why It Matters

Simplifying infrastructure is the missing step that unlocks the next wave of AI creativity.  
As **vibe coding** and **viral app creation** take off, creators want to build their own niche media tools for their communities — fast.

This API empowers them.  
Plug it into vibe coding tools, and anyone can launch their own media generation app — without worrying about pipelines, compression, or delivery.
