### The Missing Layer for AI Generated Media

- Soon, media generation will dominate AI inference.
- Everyone’s racing to build nanobanana wrappers, but:
  - No one’s reimagining the user experience, like moving from copy-pasting ChatGPT to coding in Cursor.
  - No one’s creating developer-friendly infrastructure—no “Vercel” for one-click deployment.
- That’s what I’m building:
  - A node-based canvas, like Excalidraw, to visually design media generation pipelines.
  - A backend infrastructure handling image processing, compression, and video delivery.
- Challenges I faced building my own AI media app:
  - Image generation pipelines became messy and hard to manage as code.
  - I had to handle image/video storage, retrieval, and compression to ensure fast display.
- The Solution:
  - A node-based canvas for visually creating media generation pipelines, like designing prompts in Excalidraw.
  - An API connecting to models like nanobanana, with a CDN layer for media delivery, compression, and storage out of the box.
    - Simplifying infrastructure empowers anyone to launch niche media generation apps, especially with the rise of vibe coding and viral marketing. Creators can build apps for their followers using this API with vibe coding tools.
